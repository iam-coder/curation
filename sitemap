HOME:

The front page should be as simple as possible without any bullshit.
It should mainly comprise of the following three sections:
*Home
*About us
*Contact us
These would cover the header.


At the centre:
Left part would be for some description of our work or a boottrap carousel of facts about coding/development (more
preferrabe) while the right part would be for the figure that would provide the user with the links (as decided with
manoj and akul).

@manoj: the array text that keeps on changing should be highlighted by some other means, it should be more attractive.

The bottom should include the subscription thing till beta is not released (already added), after which we can have our 
own user databse and a login system.

            *---*---*---*---*----*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*---*----*---*--*---*--*---*---*

AFTER A USER HAS SELECTED ANY PARTICULAR COURSE (separate page for this):

lets say the user has selected front-end, a list of things related to it will be shown horizontally. For eg:
CSS, JS;
if the user selects js, then things related to JS should appear below the items displayed above (they should not go away).
The user would be redirected to the link corresponding to the item clicked.

In each case the horizontal layer that gets added, it should have items in increasing order of difficulty for that 
particular thing. (for exaple: for JS, items could be in this order: plain JS and then the libraries of JS)
